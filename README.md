# ScrapingforBooks---R
I web scrape Goodreads for book titles from authors I like.

# Packages needed
- tidyverse
- rvest
- rselenium

# For quick use
Run all the code. Then simply use the `GetBookInfo` function at the bottom of the Rmd file. Input author = '(author)' and how many pages you want to scrape after the initial page.

# [Rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf)
Rvest allows you to query through an html document to retrieve the information you need.


# [RSelenium](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/RSelenium.pdf)
RSelenium allows you to navigate through a webpage, click on elements, and even input key words into input boxes. It also allows you to navigate through different links and pages in your webpage.
